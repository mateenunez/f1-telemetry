# F1 Telemetry
##### F1 Telemetry is a real-time Formula 1 dashboard that allows for comprehensive tracking of every Formula 1 race 🏁

### 📦 Installation
I recommend using **pnpm** to install dependencies. You must configure the following environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS
# Both handles API connections.
```
### 🫂 Contributing
You can join our **Discord** to report an issue or contribute to the code. All you need to do is install the dependencies and run the project using **pnpm**.

### 🦕 Support our Hosting
F1 Telemetry will always be free, but due to the growing number of users, we have upgraded to a VPS! If you would like to support us and help keep the project running, please get in touch.
